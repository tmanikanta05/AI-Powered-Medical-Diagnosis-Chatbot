# AI-Powered Medical Diagnosis & Chatbot

This project leverages AI-powered tools for medical image analysis and a chatbot interface to provide insights into various medical conditions. The app uses YOLO (You Only Look Once) models for detecting diseases in images and integrates with Google's Gemini AI for generating medical insights through natural language queries.

## Features

- **Medical Image Analysis**: Upload or capture images to detect conditions such as:
  - Anomalies
  - Cavity
  - Fracture
  - Eye Disease
  - Monkeypox
  - Liver Disease
  - (Additional models like Brain Tumor can be added)

- **AI Chatbot**: Ask medical-related questions, and the AI will provide relevant insights.

## Requirements

Before running the application, make sure you have the following libraries installed:

- `streamlit`
- `google-generativeai`
- `Pillow`
- `ultralytics`
- `torch`
- `openai` (for Gemini API)
- `requests` (for API calls)

You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install streamlit google-generativeai Pillow ultralytics torch openai requests
```

## Setup

1. **Download the YOLO Models**:
   - The YOLO models should be downloaded from the appropriate sources or trained based on your use case. Ensure that you have the model files (e.g., `anamoly.pt`, `hi.pt`, etc.) in the correct directory where your script is running.
   
2. **Set API Key for Google Gemini**:
   - You will need to configure the API key for Google's Gemini model. Ensure you have a valid API key for `google-generativeai` and replace the placeholder key in the code:
     ```python
     genai.configure(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")
     ```

3. **Run the Application**:
   After ensuring all dependencies are installed and configurations are set, you can run the app using:

   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

   This will launch the Streamlit app in your default web browser.

## Functionality

### Medical Image Analysis

- **Upload an Image**: You can upload an image of medical relevance (e.g., X-ray, MRI, etc.) and the system will analyze it for various conditions.
  
- **Camera Input**: If you're using a device with a camera, you can take a photo directly and the app will analyze it for potential diseases.

- **Bounding Box Detection**: If a disease is detected, the system will highlight the area of interest using bounding boxes and provide information about the detected condition(s).

- **AI Insights**: Once a condition is detected, the app uses Google‚Äôs Gemini model to generate relevant insights about the condition.

### AI Chatbot

- **Medical Queries**: The chatbot is designed to answer medical-related questions. Simply type your query, and the assistant will provide a response based on the available insights from Gemini.

## Application Interface

### Tab 1: **Medical Image Analysis**
- Upload or capture a medical image.
- Click on "üîç Analyze Image" to detect conditions and get insights.
- The app displays detected conditions and their bounding boxes on the image.
- AI-generated insights related to the detected conditions will be displayed.

### Tab 2: **AI Chatbot**
- Ask any medical-related question and receive responses based on Gemini AI.
- The chat history is stored, allowing you to refer to previous queries and answers.

## Example Use Cases

- **Detecting Diseases in Medical Images**: Upload X-ray or MRI images to detect fractures, cavities, eye diseases, liver diseases, etc.
  
- **Medical Advice**: Ask the chatbot about symptoms, conditions, and general medical inquiries to receive insights generated by AI.
